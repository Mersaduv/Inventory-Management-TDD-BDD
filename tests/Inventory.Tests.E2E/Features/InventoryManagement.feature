Feature: Inventory Management

    As A Aarehouse Keeper
    I Want To Keep Track Of My Inventory
    So That I Always Have Accurate Info About Products Stock


    Scenario: Defining New Inventory
        Given I Want To Add The Following Inventory
            | Product | UnitPrice |
            | IPhone  | 1100      |
        When I Try To Define This Inventory
        Then The Inventory Should Be Created
        And It Should Be Empty
